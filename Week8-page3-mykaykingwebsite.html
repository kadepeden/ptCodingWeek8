        <H3>Getting to know Kade</H3>
        <p>Kayaking has really changed how I relate to the Pacific Northwest. I used to lament our long winter season with it's heavy rain and grays skys, but now I look forward to the water flowing in our beautiful rivers and the fun that all of the precipitation will bring.</p>
